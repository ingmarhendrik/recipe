        <h3 class="mt-4">Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
                <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 cup onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>4 oz Parmesan, grated</li>
                <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
         </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring stock to a simmer in a large saucepan. Keep warm over low heat, but do not boil.</li>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add oil to the pot; swirl to coat.  (Everything from here on will be added to this pot.)</li>
            <li>Add onion; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the Arborio rice and salt, cook 1 minute, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup stock; cook 2 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 1/2 cups stock; cook 4 minutes or until liquid is nearly absorbed, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Add remaining stock, 3/4 cup at a time, stirring nearly constantly until each portion is absorbed before adding the next (about 20-25 minutes); reserve 1/3 cup stock at last addition.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in reserved remaining stock, butter, pepper, and cheese.</li>
            <li>Top the risotto with parsley.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Notes</h3>

        <p>Be mindful of salt as the stock will likely already be salty enough. I felt the recipe needed an extra 1/4 tsp but use your own discretion. I also added a splash of cream at the very end just before serving, but this is optional. As a general rule: 1 cup of dry Arborio rice yields 3 cups of cooked rice.</p>
